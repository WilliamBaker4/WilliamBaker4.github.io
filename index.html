			<p>My first passion was drawing. I was inspired by Tim Burton and many other artists, most of them being YouTubers. I thought I could get into the video game industry as a concept artist. You can see some of my sketches here on this website.</p>

			<p>Since I was in high school, I have had a strong interest in 3D Modeling and creating 3D Art. After discovering 3d modeling, I thought this was going to be my way into game development. My software of choice is Blender 3D. You can check out my 3D gallery for some of the renders and models I have done in the past.</p>

			<p>I have always wanted to be a video game programmer. My introduction to video game development was in Blender 3d. Back then, Blender had a basic game engine included. My first video game projects were done in that engine, using the logic bricks. Since Blender's game engine is no longer supported, I have had to look elsewhere. For about 2 or 3 years after Blender discontinued their engine, I focused on just modeling. I picked up programming at university, and that made me try my hand at video game development again. That is when I came across The Godot Engine.</p>

			<p>While learning the Godot Engine, I have been working on and off a project that I called "Project Space Cadet". It started as a simple side-scroller that I used for practice. I animated the player character first. Then after a year, while I was learning the engine, I scrapped everything and started from over. I redesigned the player and started designing other characters and enemies.</p>

			<p>I have programmed in many different languages and almost on the daily, I learn something new about them. I love programming and learning about computer software. I find my tool belt is always expanding.</p>

				This website is still under construction. I am hard at work making it awesome. In the meantime, you can go to the Gallery and see some of the things I have done. More to come.
